# AI-Assisted ETL/ELT (Autonomous Data Pipeline)

An end-to-end ETL/ELT pipeline where parts of the Transform are suggested/generated by an LLM:
- Multiple data sources (CSV/JSON/API)
- LLM suggests cleaning/mapping code and auto-docs
- Data quality validation (pandera)
- Warehouse in DuckDB (commit-safe); optional Postgres later
- Orchestration with Prefect; basic monitoring/logging
